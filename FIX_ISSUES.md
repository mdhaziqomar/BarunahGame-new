# 🔧 Fixing Barunah Issues

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Duplicate Questions on Database Migration** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Seed scripts were creating duplicate questions every time they ran.

**Solution**: 
- Created `seed-clean.ts` that properly clears existing data before seeding
- Updated `seed-real.ts` to handle duplicates with try-catch
- Updated Render build script to use clean seeding

**To fix locally**:
```bash
cd BarunahGame-new/server
npm run db:seed:clean
```

### 2. **Authentication Lost on Page Refresh** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Users had to re-login every time they refreshed the page.

**Solution**: 
- Added token verification on app startup in `AuthContext.tsx`
- App now checks for existing token in localStorage on startup
- Automatically restores user session if token is valid

**What happens now**:
- User logs in → token stored in localStorage
- User refreshes page → app checks token → automatically logs user back in
- Token expires → user redirected to login

### 3. **Question Updates Not Reflecting** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When questions were updated in admin, they didn't show in the game.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper error handling in seed scripts
- Questions are now properly refreshed on database changes
- Admin dashboard shows real-time question data

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### For Local Development:
1. **Safe seeding** (preserves existing users):
   ```bash
   cd BarunahGame-new/server
   npm run db:seed:safe
   ```

2. **Clean seeding** (removes ALL data including users):
   ```bash
   cd BarunahGame-new/server
   npm run db:seed:clean
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the fixes**:
   - Login and refresh the page (should stay logged in)
   - Check that questions aren't duplicated
   - Verify admin dashboard shows correct data

### For Render.com Deployment:
The build script has been updated to use the safe seeding (preserves existing users):
```json
"render-build": "npm install && prisma generate && npm run build && prisma db push && npm run db:seed:safe"
```

This will:
1. Install dependencies
2. Generate Prisma client
3. Build the application
4. Push database schema changes
5. Run clean seeding (no duplicates)

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

After deployment, verify these work:

1. **Authentication Persistence**:
   - Login to the app
   - Refresh the page
   - Should remain logged in

2. **No Duplicate Questions**:
   - Check admin dashboard
   - Should see exact number of questions (10 for now)
   - No duplicate entries

3. **Question Updates**:
   - Edit a question in admin dashboard
   - Changes should reflect immediately
   - Game should show updated questions

## 📝 **Default Accounts**

After clean seeding, you'll have these accounts:

- **Admin**: `admin@barunah.edu.bn` / `admin123`
- **Vendor**: `vendor@local-store.bn` / `vendor123`

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### If you still have duplicates:
```bash
cd BarunahGame-new/server
npm run db:seed:safe  # This preserves existing users
```

### If you need to completely reset (WARNING: removes all users):
```bash
cd BarunahGame-new/server
npx prisma db push --force-reset
npm run db:seed:clean
```

### If authentication still doesn't persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify JWT_SECRET is set in environment
3. Check that localStorage is enabled

### If questions don't update:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check admin dashboard for errors
3. Verify database connection

## 🎯 **Summary**

These fixes resolve:
- ✅ No more duplicate questions on migration
- ✅ Users stay logged in after page refresh
- ✅ Question updates reflect immediately
- ✅ Clean database seeding process
- ✅ Better error handling throughout

The app should now work smoothly without these annoying issues!
